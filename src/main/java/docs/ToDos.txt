ToDos (MOTHER FUCKER !!!!)
===========================
6) isMITM? in info
	- min SDK
	- phone Android version
	- analyze net Sec Conf file

	
----------------NOT SO IMPORTANT--------------
CLI
====
1) pkg options (such as -info) without -pkg option given [Not so important]
2) No options, missing options --> print help message
3) good CLI
4) Update help: conf directory explanation ( so far it's mentioned, so not that important)
5) type log file name in the output of start command
7) H1 at the beginning of any command's output

6) no component: don'T execute anything	
8) what does BC receiver result code (0,1) mean ? MAHH


6)
==================================== UnSolved =======================================


Squeeze
========
			1- multiline comments start with /* or *
			??2- strings at the end 

Command
=======
1) error handling: what happens when a command fails !!!!!!!!!!
	{i- print sderror & check err code		ii- exception !}
	a) copy shit from sdcard

DataUriHandler
==============
1- Check if commands are added properly when only mimeType exists
3- scheme without host?? like content:// w khalas?



==================================== Next Version ======================================

Better Code
===========
1) General Utilities class, containing:
	ClassExtras.getRegexFromString
	Remove Duplicates
	
Base64 (still not working)
============
- decode base64 files / parts of files	
- get all base64 encoded words (if it makes sense)

Searcher
=========
- Search also in APK

Find in code:
=============
- print full path (Searcher.java line 51)
- specify external code location
- Search for the word Key (although too many results)

Start
=====
		- Start with and without launcher (now only without)
- exclude a component in start

Data Dir
========
- Check if any of the files are globally readable

Core
=======
- detect starting service and know what is the reason for it (and if it makes sense)!!
- in manifest: activity has parent activity?

Extras
=======
1) IN NEXT VERSION: LaunchInfoActivity/AllInOneActivity issue, Either:
	- Get all Intents started in the class and check for their extras as well (Maybe for exported activities only)
	- Look for a smarter solution

DB
==
2) maybe sha DataDir before I copy it
		3) option not to copy datadir if it'S too big

Code analysis
==============
1) Alternative for JD
2) Tickler configuration file: java code location instead of decompiled
3) exclude google and unimportant stuff


3) Manifest
============
a) Permissions of each component and whether it is secured or not
b) Metadata tag
c) activitiy parent?


Dex2Jar (Not very important)
=======
Get the right Lib directory name

Copy
====
SHA before and after to make sure copy went correctly

==================================== Solved =======================================
Important WTF
=============
1) get data from any content provider (COOL: just print the output)


Logs
====
		1- 2 threads sharing the same file (solved by flushing in the while loop of writing)
		Con: the log file misses a couple of lines when the Launcher starts (therefore they should not be important)

		2- log file gets overridden
		Solution: logReader uses FileWriter and appends to the output log file

Manifest
=========
		1- Activity Alias tag (Done using XmlElements)
		
		
CodeUtil
========
					1- Make sure while filtering the duplicated extras that you have default values (I think Fuck default values)
					2- If there are no default values then propose any
					3- Make sure that L and F are required (No L and F)
					4- Prepare to list Extras (Done but without default values)

Info Disclosure 
===============
				1) getLog() or Log.
2) Key (although too many results) 
				3) Regex of //
				4) multiline comments start with /* or *
				

Extras
=======
			2) TODO: 2 matches in the same line (Extras of com.google.android.calendar.AllInOneCalendarActivity are missing)
			3) serializable, string arrays extra extra (check extra type before adding it)
			4) double extra (am does not support Double type, entered as float)					

DataUriHandler
==============
1- Check if commands are added properly when only mimeType exists
		2- replace the .* in some URLs (Done: replaced by a dummy value TiCkLeR)
3- scheme without host?? like content:// w khalas?
4- Why PathPrefix of com.android.calendar.event.LaunchInfoActivity are empty???? (Fixed)

DAtaDir
=======
2) copy dataDir to a chosen destination

Pull data dir
==============
1) Duolingo hige delay / freeze [print output between start and waitFor()]

Others
======
3) no devices: error of 2 or more devices are connected

Start 
=====
1) (retest) After start finishes, the tool does not stop and the log file is not clsoed.	
Solved by introducing a LogController class with a isStop boolean 
2) Logs with start component
3) start without launcher :( [set isLauncher : false in execureTriggerCommands to disable launcher by default]
	- Strange that all adb logcat messages are saved in my logfile


Content Prov
============
1) empty Content URI returned to the start and list commands

Rewrite
=======
2) Rewrite:
	SmaliAnalyzer (unused !!!!)

APK zipped directory
====================
3) certificates in assets
